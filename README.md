# CLI Turn-based Fighting Game # 

## About ##
This program reads data from a JSON document containing creature and move data and uses that data to create a turn-based 2-player game. Each player takes turns performing an action (using a move, reviving another creature, or switching to another creature) until either a player surrenders or all of the creatures dies. When both players choose to use a move, the creature with the faster speed stat will go first.
